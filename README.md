# Pomodoro Timer
#### *My Pomodoro Timer App is based on a well-known study technique invented by Francesco Cirillo. Users start a session by selecting a duration for a Study interval, and a duration for a break interval. After clicking Start, the session begins. A timer counts down for the designated study interval, plays an alarm when it reaches the end, then starts a countdown for the duration of the break interval. After the break ends, the alarm plays once again, and a study interval starts anew. This cycle continues indefinitely until the user either clicks Stop to stop and clear the session, or the user clicks Pause.*
